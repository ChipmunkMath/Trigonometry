%!TEX program = xelatex
\documentclass[12pt, aspectratio=169]{beamer}
	% 12pt: Increase base text size to make reading easier.
	% aspectratio=169: Gives aspect ratio of 16:9 for better screen use and matching most commonly used aspect ratios. (Arguable that 1610 would be better, but the die is cast.)


\usetheme[nooffset, noslidenumbers, blockbg]{m}
	% Theme showed by 'm' is "mtheme". It is a non-standard Beamer theme.
		% Theme was made by Matthias Vogelgesang. Thanks to him and other contributers.
		% Can find theme on GitHub: https://github.com/matze/mtheme
	% nooffset: Prevents mtheme from adding \vspace{2em} vertical offset at top of slides
	% noslidenumbers: Omits slide numbers on all slides

	\setbeamertemplate{blocks}[rounded][shadow=true]
	% This rounds blocks and gives a dropshadow to blocks.
		% Note the slightly odd presentation of options here. This has to be done.
			% If combined to [option1, option2], it actually breaks both. Go figure.


%%% Package loadout and descriptions %%%
\usepackage{graphicx} % Allows insertion of images
\usepackage{xcolor} % Enables the ability to work with colors
\usepackage{mathtools} % Loads various math things
	% Package above loads 'amsmath', a very useful package to load for math typesetting
\usepackage{booktabs} % Helps make prettier tables
\usepackage{array} % Helps make better, more customizable arrays/tables

%%% Standardized spacing commands %%%
		%%% This is a bit of a hack, but it's important for spacings to look consistent. As such, here is a "standardized" set of vspace sizes. Try to use them in a consistent manner as you build slides.
\newcommand{\as}{\vspace{0.1cm}} % A *small* space.
\newcommand{\bs}{\bigskip} % Good ol' \bigskip, just shorter for writing.
\newcommand{\cs}{\vspace{1cm}} % A *large* space for clear separation of ideas.
\newcommand{\zs}{\vspace{-0.3cm}} % A negative space for tightening things as needed.
