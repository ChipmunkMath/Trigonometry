=========================
Lesson (basic and essential concepts)
=========================
- ??? Motivation?
	+ What's a good way to motivate special right triangles?
	+ Could begin by making connection to previous lesson on similarity, wondering if there are certain triangle "shapes" it's easy to know a lot about.

- 45-45-90 Triangle
	+ Diagram with 's' for short legs and s*sqrt(2) for hypotenuse.
	+ Give example where we know one leg, fill in other two
	+ Give example where we know hypotenuse, find legs

- 30-60-90 Triangle
	+ Diagram with 's' for short leg, s*sqrt(3) for long leg, and 2s for hypotenuse.
	+ Point out importance of knowing which leg you're dealing with (unlike 45-45-90, where the legs matched, here you have to pay closer attention to opposite angles)
	+ Give example where we know one short leg, fill in other two
	+ Give example where we know hypotenuse, fill in other two
		= Point out that it's useful to find short leg first, since diagram was built around short leg
	+ Give example where we know long leg, fill in other two
		= Re-emphasize value of finding short leg first.


=========================
Advanced Understanding (non-essential concepts, proofs, etc.)
=========================
- Proof of 45-45-90
	+ Create a 45-45-90 triangle with one leg side 's'.
	+ Isosceles, so now know both legs are 's'.
	+ Apply pythag thm to find hypotenuse.

- Proof of 30-60-90
	+ Begin with equilateral triangle, side length of '2s'
	+ Split down "middle" with a perpendicular
	+ Note 30-60-90 and that short leg is now 1s = s.
	+ Apply pythag thm to find long leg.


=========================
Practice Problems [ * corresponds to difficulty, out of 3]
=========================
- (*) 2x 45-45-90 problems: one begins with a leg, one begins with hypotenuse

- (*) 3x 30-60-90 problems: one begins with short leg, one begins with hypotenuse, one begins with long leg

- (**) 1x Simple algebra problem on 30-60-90 triangle

- (**) Mix of two 30-60-90 triangles with a 45-45-90 glued between them
	= See #2 on this page for a better idea: http://www.regentsprep.org/regents/math/algtrig/att2/pracspecial.htm

- (***) Find the area of a regular hexagon
