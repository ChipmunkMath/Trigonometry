[Note: ||| symbol means that it was a change or addition made from original v1 draft. In future versions, might want to do something even more specific, like ||{name of suggester}||. Unsure if it's useful to have an easy reference to why changes are being made. But might help evaluations if I look at something and scratch my head as to why it's there.]


Lesson Plan v1
April 28, 2015


=========================
Lesson (basic and essential concepts)
=========================
- Begin by motivating the idea
	+ Show how the sides of a right triangle are connected: if any one side changes, the others have to vary in response. Preferably show this with an animation.
	+ While discussing the above, define the terms "hypotenuse" and "leg".

- Say that people have figured out how they must relate to each other. We can express this relationship with the equation "a^2 + b^2 = c^2" (picture of triangle with letters located appropriately)
	+ Point out that 'a' and 'b' match to the legs, while 'c' matches to the hypotenuse. Note that we we could also write out the equation as "(leg)^2 + (leg)^2 = (hypotenuse)^2".
	+ We call this equation "The Pythagorean Theorem"
		= Named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras. While he wasn't the first person to notice this special relationship, he may have been the first person to actually prove that it's always true. In any case, by tradition, we name it after him.
	+ Notice that the theorem only applies to /right/ triangles!

- Formally state Pythagorean theorem
	+ Mention that if you're going to memorize one formula ever in your math career, this is probably the one to memorize.

- Give very simple example of Pythagorean theorem in use (don't use a Pythagorean triple, purposefully have it come out with a simple radical)
		+ Legs are length 2 and 4, hypotenuse is unknown [Answer= 2*sqrt(5)]
		+ ||| Briefly mention calculator use. If they haven't worked with radicals before, they can just take square root and use a calculator.
			= ||| Also mention that this is a great way to check your simplification if they find radicals challenging: compare square root with simplified square root. For example, on this problem we would check if sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). It does, so we know we simplified correctly.

- Motivate idea of a converse: "what if we had a triangle, but wanted to check if it was a right triangle?"
	+ The Pythagorean theorem works in reverse! When a theorem "works in reverse", we call the "backwards" version the /converse/ of the theorem.

- Formally state converse of Pythagorean theorem

- Re-use answer from above simple example, but this time show that a triangle with such sides must be a right triangle by the converse.
	+ While plugging in, point out that you need to plug in using parentheses!


=========================
Advanced Understanding (non-essential concepts, proofs, etc.)
=========================
- Proof of Pythagorean Theorem
	+ Mention that there's lots of ways to prove it, the following is just one possible way.
	+ Proof: Begin with a right triangle. Construct square out of four congruent right triangles. Note that area of large square must equal area of four triangles added to area of inner square. Do algebra to arrive at result.
		= Image: http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/images/pythagorean-theorem-proof.png

- Reason out why the Pythagorean converse makes sense.
	+ Briefly mention we haven't proved the Pythagorean converse, but we will in a few minutes. Just take it for granted right now.
	+ Start from a right triangle where a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
	+ Notice that if we shrink 'c' a little bit, the right angle is forced to compress to being under 90deg: that is, we now have an acute triangle.
		= Show by animation, please. (Keep "base" leg fixed in place. Animation is more accurate but more difficult if both legs stay fixed length and we have more angle motion. Less accurate but easier to animate if we allow a bit of cheating by "side" leg changing.)
	+ On the other hand, if we expand 'c' a little, the right angle is forced to grow beyond 90deg: we now have an obtuse triangle.
		= Once again, animation. (Same notes as above.)

- Formally restate converse of Pythagorean theorem, along with inequalities. [||| A lot of this is new or redone.]
	+ Note that 'c' no longer means hypotenuse in this case, it just means the longest side of the triangle.
	+ Point out that it's easy to remember these three cases because:
		= a^2 + b^2 = c^2 --> That's Pythag Thm, so no surprise it's a right triangle.
		= a^2 + b^2 < OR > c^2 --> Doesn't match Pythag Thm, so NOT a right triangle.
		= If a^2 + b^2 < c^2, then 'c' is "rather large", so, since triangle sides are associated with opposite angles, its angle must be "big" as well --> obtuse
		= If a^2 + b^2 > c^2, then 'c' is "smaller than usual", so, similarly, its angle must be "smaller than usual", where usual would be a right angle. Since that angle still has to be the biggest (c is still largest side, so has largest associated angle), none of the angles are larger than 90deg --> acute

- Proof of converse of Pythagorean theorem
	+ While it seems reasonable that the converse is true, note that we haven't actually proven we can trust it yet.
	+ Show proof of converse (Start with triangle where equation holds; construct a right triangle that uses same legs; by pythagorean theorem on new triangle, we have SSS congruence. Therefore the first triangle must also have been a right triangle.)

||| Go hand-wavey on "proof" for Pythag Converse Inequalities. Also reorganized some of the above structuring to present reasoning before memorization of inequalities.


=========================
Practice Problems [ * corresponds to difficulty, out of 3]
=========================
- (*) Right triangle, solve for hypotenuse. Legs are 5 and 10. [Answer= 5*sqrt(5)]
	||| Changed: previous numbers were really big to work with.

- (*) Right triangle, solve for leg. Hypotenuse is 17, known leg is 8. [Answer= 15]
	+ Point out that this is a Pythagorean triple and they can watch the video on that for more info.

- (*) Two triangles with all legs known. Which triangle is a right triangle? Triangle A) 11, 8, 6;  Triangle B) 15, 12, 9. [Answer= Triangle A is not, B is right triangle]
	+ Point out that Triangle A must be obtuse (NOPE, see below) because 11^2 > 8^2 + 6^2, which we talked about in the Advanced Understanding video.
		||||| Redo as an ACUTE triangle. The work in Advanced Understanding winds up showing an obtuse example, so do different here.

- (**) Algebra. Solve for unknown variable. Right triangle with hypotenuse of (x+5), legs of 12 and (x-3). [Answer= x=8]

- (**) Graphical problem. Square with side length of 5, find length of diagonal. [Answer= 5sqrt(2)]

- (***) Word problem. Have a ladder that is 6m tall, to do all the work, the top of the ladder has to be at least 5m up the wall. What is the maximum distance the bottom of the ladder can be from the wall?
		||||| Changed ladder height to more sane value of 4m. As such, 


=========================
Quick Review (very fast overview of essentials)
=========================
- State Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 with graphic of triangle
	+ Stress that 'c' is the hypotenuse, opposite right angle, largest side
	+ Stress that thm only works on right triangles
	+ Stress that it's worth it to memorize this formula

- Point out that when plugging in to formula, it is important to use parentheses for anything other than a very simple number.

- State converse to Pythagorean theorem

- [NOPE] Quickly mention inequalities in regards to converse: a^2 + b^2 > c^2 means obtuse triangle, a^2 + b^2 < c^2 means acute.
		||||| NOPE: I removed the inequalities from basic lesson, now in advanced. I can mention they can check out advanced, but don't show it here.

- ||| Mention pythagorean triples -- knowing them can help speed you up on tests, plug the extra video lesson if they want more info.


=========================
Extra: Pythagorean Triples (mainly to help students do better on standardized tests)
=========================
- Simple example of a 3-4-5 right triangle
	+ Note how "clean" it is: aren't whole numbers lovely?

- Name this "clean" thing a "Pythagorean Triple", formally define it.

- State some of the low (first five or so?) Pythagorean triples.
	+ Point out that any multiple of a triple (scaling all numbers by same number) is also a triple.

- Mention that you'll often see Pythagorean triples on tests (after all, math instructors love "clean" answers). Thus, game the system! Memorize the first few triples. This especially helps on tests where time is at a premium.

- See some examples in action:
	+ Right triangle with hypotenuse 10, leg of 6, and an unknown leg.
		= If you know your triples, super easy and fast.
		= Take time to show how you would do by hand, and compare speeds.
	+ Repeat problem from Practice Problems: " Solve for unknown variable. Right triangle with hypotenuse of (x+5), legs of 12 and (x-3). [Answer= x=8]"
		= Point that if you know triple 5-12-13, you can quickly brute force the answer.

- Prove that earlier claim of scaling triples by a constant factor does result in another triple.
	+ ||| Mention that this is connected to the idea of "Similarity", which we go over in another lesson module.
	+ ||| After it has been proven, note that you could even scale by a non-natural number. Could be weird and whacky! (If time allows, give a quick example of a decimal one, like scaling a 3-4-5 by 0.7. After, point out that it doesn't even have to be a rational, you could scale by something even weirder, like pi or sqrt[47].) However, while these result in right triangles, it's not technically a triple because they're not all integers.


- List first 16 Pythagorean triple primitives. Say that you might find it useful to memorize all of them, but that 95% of test questions will only use...
	+ Disappear all but the first three primitives (3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-5-17)
	+ "Or a multiple of one of them": Have multiples of 3-4-5 appear as well
	+ Stress that while interesting, knowing the Pythagorean triples is really only useful for increasing your speed on some kinds of tests, but isn't important for understanding math in general.
	+ ||| Also point out that, while Pythag triples do pop up a lot on tests, it isn't a guarantee. Don't automatically assume that's the only kind of answer you can get. It's fast and easy to check though, so it's usually good to think of first.
